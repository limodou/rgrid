# rGrid

Used to implement common data grid widget based on Riot. It includes:

* rtable Core widget, used for data grid display
* pagination
* query_config Query condition widget
* dataset Data source API
* rGrid Data grid which combined above components.

## Install

rGrid depends on Riot, jQuery mainly. They are not included in this project, so
you can install them via bower:

```
bower install jquery riot
```

Examples think these packages should be installed in `bower_components` of rGrid
project directory.

Source tags are exists in src directory, it should be compiled via Riot. You can
install Riot via npm(It's not the same as bower). The compiled .js files are already
placed in dist directory, you can use the directly.

For example:

```
npm install riot
```

then compile `rtable.tag` or other tag files like:

```
riot -w rtable.tag ../dist
```

## Development description

For now, the functionalities is simple, and the performance is not so good I think,
but I hope I can improve it continuously, and also hope you can help this project
with me.
